Se intendiamo utilizzare le funzioni di aggiunta automatica dei torrent presenti nella cartella controllo prima creata, dovremo aggiungere la configurazione relativa al file.
Dobbiamo quindi aggiungere due righe in fondo al file, prima della parentesi graffa, facendo attenzione a una cosa: ogni riga termina con una virgola, tranne l’ultima.
Andremo quindi a aggiungere una virgola in fondo a quella che è ora l’ultima riga, e poi aggiungeremo le seguenti:

Skip hooking it back up to all the peripherals and quickly add in Wi-Fi support from the command line.
Why Do I Want to Do This?</p><p>The best way to avoid falling into that trap is to configure your Raspberry Pi for remote access. Once you have that configured, however, you still need to know how to do tasks remotely that would previously be handled by a GUI interface (like turning on the Wi-Fi). Today we’re going to walk you through the technical (but simple) way to remotely connect to your Pi and activate a Wi-Fi add-on dongle.
What Do I Need?</p><p>If you don’t use this Wi-Fi dongle model, we strongly recommend researching the model you intend to purchase to see if it is well supported. To that end, the USB Wi-Fi adapter section of the RPi wiki is very helpful.</p><p>In addition to the above items, you need to take a moment to check the configuration of the Wi-Fi node you intend to connect your Raspberry Pi unit to: you’ll need to make note of the SSID, password, and encryption type/method (e.g. the node is using WPA with TKIP shared-key encryption).
Enabling the Wi-Fi Dongle via the Terminal</p><p>To get started, power up your Raspberry Pi unit without the Wi-Fi dongle attached. At this point, the only network device should be the onboard Ethernet NIC (which you have connected to your network via Ethernet cable so you can remotely access the headless device).</p><p>Connect to your Pi via SSH to access a remote terminal prompt. (If you have not yet configured your device for remote access in this fashion, please review the following tutorial).</p><p>At the prompt, enter the following command:</p><pre class="literallayout">sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces</pre><p>In the nano text editor, you’ll see something like this:</p><pre class="literallayout">auto lo</pre><pre class="literallayout">iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp</pre><p>That’s the very basic configuration that governs your Pi’s Ethernet connect (indicated by the eth0 portion). We need to add on a very minor bit to enable the Wi-Fi dongle. Use the arrow keys to move down below the existing entry and add the following lines:</p><pre class="literallayout">allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp</pre><p>Once you’ve annotated the file, press CTRL+X to save the file and exit the nano editor. At the prompt again, enter the following command:</p><pre class="literallayout">sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</pre><p>Compare the contents of the file, if it exists, to the following code. If the file is empty, you can use this code to populate it. Take note of the commented lines (indicated by the # marks) to reference which variable you should use based on your current Wi-Fi node configuration.</p><pre class="literallayout">ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev

}</pre><p>When you’re done editing the file, press CTRL+X to save and exit the document. Now is the time to unplug the Ethernet cable and plug in the Wi-Fi dongle.</p><p>At the command prompt, enter the following command:</p><pre class="literallayout">sudo reboot</pre><p>When the device finishes rebooting, it should automatically connect to the Wi-Fi node. If for some reason it fails to appear on the network, you can always plug the Ethernet cable back in to double check the two files and the variables you altered.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_fix_video_source"></a>Fix Video Source</h4></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

The buffermode sets what videos XBMC will cache. The default is 0, which will cache all videos from the internet (http, FTP, WebDAV, etc.). Listed below are other options:</p><pre class="literallayout">1 Buffer all videos, including local videos
2 Buffer only true internet streams (http, strm, etc.)
3 No buffer</pre><p>If you experience XBMC stuttering while playing videos from your local network storage, then choose 1 as Buffermode. Playing from a USB drive or SD card should almost never cause XBMC buffering issues unless there is some hardware compatibility issue.
cachemembuffersize</p><p>By default XBMC allocates 20 MB for cache (note that in reality this is require 3 times more free RAM, 60 MB in this case). If you choose to cache videos, then increasing the available cache memory may help. On Raspberry Pi, with OpenELEC, Xbian or Raspbmc, I would not go beyond 40 or 50 MB (note that this requires 120 or 150 MB of free RAM) or else XBMC might crash frequently. To set cachemembuffersize to say 40 MB use 41943040 (40 x 1024 x 1024). If you are on a full-blown HTPC with say 4 GB RAM, you could go higher.</p><p>Alternatively, you could set the cachemembuffersize to 0, which would force XBMC to use your local storage (SD Card) for caching videos. In this case, the cache size is only limited by the amount of free space available. Upon stopping the video the cache is automatically cleared to free up space. Note that this will increase the read/write on your SD card, which may reduce its lifespan. But SD cards are cheap and doing this can help low RAM devices such as Raspberry Pi. But a good SD card with higher class rating is definitely recommended.

Positive affect
</span></dt><dd>
A technical term to describe the experience of feeling a positive emotion, such as joy, love, or amusement. As Dr. Lyubomirsky notes above, positive affect is an important ingredient to happiness and is sometimes used synonymously with happiness, though it generally refers to a fleeting emotional state rather than an enduring way of being. It is often measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Subjective well-being
</span></dt><dd>
As mentioned above, researchers often use this term interchangably with happiness, perhaps because it sounds more precise and scientific. It refers to the way people evaluate their lives, in terms of both their global life satisfaction and emotional states—i.e., it is often assessed by measuring life satisfaction and positive affect. It is strongly tied to positive health.

The happy are what Aristotle calls “happy few.” They are, if you like, the ethical elite. This is not a democratic conception of happiness.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing bad about feeling good. But I would suggest that something of value may have been lost or forgotten in our transition to modern ideas of happiness. We can’t feel good all the time; nor, I think, should we want to. Nor should we assume that happiness can be had (maybe a better word?) without a certain degree of effort, and possibly even sacrifice and pain. These are things that the older traditions knew—in the West and the East alike—and that we have forgotten.</p><p>Indeed, if you think about it, this idea of happiness as a natural state creates a curious problem. What if I’m not happy? Does that mean that I’m unnatural? Am I ill, or bad, or deficient? Is there something wrong with me? Is there something wrong with the society in which I live? These are all symptoms of a condition that I call the unhappiness of not being happy, and it is a peculiarly modern condition.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_five_differences_between_a_happy_life_and_a_meaningful_one"></a>11.14. Five differences between a happy life and a meaningful one</h3></div></div></div><pre class="literallayout">Happy people satisfy their wants and needs, but that seems largely irrelevant to a meaningful life. Therefore, health, wealth, and ease in life were all related to happiness, but not meaning.</pre><pre class="literallayout">Happiness involves being focused on the present, whereas meaningfulness involves thinking more about the past, present, and future—and the relationship between them.In addition, happiness was seen as fleeting, while meaningfulness seemed to last longer.</pre><pre class="literallayout">Meaningfulness is derived from giving to other people; happiness comes from what they give to you. Although social connections were linked to both happiness and meaning, happiness was connected more to the benefits one receives from social relationships, especially friendships, while meaningfulness was related to what one gives to others—for example, taking care of children. Along these lines, self-described “takers” were happier than self-described “givers,” and spending time with friends was linked to happiness more than meaning, whereas spending more time with loved ones was linked to meaning but not happiness.</pre><pre class="literallayout">Meaningful lives involve stress and challenges. Higher levels of worry, stress, and anxiety were linked to higher meaningfulness but lower happiness, which suggests that engaging in challenging or difficult situations that are beyond oneself or one’s pleasures promotes meaningfulness but not happiness.</pre><pre class="literallayout">Self-expression is important to meaning but not happiness. Doing things to express oneself and caring about personal and cultural identity were linked to a meaningful life but not a happy one.

Affective forecasting
</span></dt><dd>
The process of making predictions about how you will feel in the future. According to Daniel Gilbert, who coined the term "affective forecasting" with his colleague Timothy Wilson, affective forecasting is simply "the process by which people look into their future and make predictions about what they’ll like and what they won’t like." However, as Emiliana explained in the previous video, we are often poor judges in the present of what will bring us happiness in the future, causing us to look for happiness in the wrong places.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Impact bias
</span></dt><dd>
The tendency to overestimate how an event or experience in the future will affect our emotional well-being, for better or worse. For instance, we often underestimate our ability to recover from difficult experiences, an ability that Gilbert calls our "psychological immune system." He documented this bias in a study that found people generally overestimate how various defeats or rejections—such as a romantic breakup or being turned down for a job—will impact their happiness. Impact bias is a major cause of mistakes in affective forecasting. It can lead us to avoid certain decisions or activities out of an inflated fear that they will harm our happiness or to covet certain outcomes (such as winning the lottery) that don’t actually boost our happiness as much as we think they will.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Set point theory
</span></dt><dd>
The theory that we each have a relatively stable level of happiness that is largely determined by our genes and personality. Though we might experience some fluctuations in happiness due to events big and small, this theory holds that we eventually return to our basic set point of happiness.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Hedonic adaptation
</span></dt><dd>
(aka the "hedonic treadmill"): Our ability to adapt to changes in our life circumstances or sensory experiences. Research suggests many of us have a remarkable ability to get used to things that might initially bring us pleasure, such as getting married or winning the lottery, and even to eventually return to our happiness set point after a traumatic accident. Some researchers, such as Ed Diener at the University of Illinois, however, have argued that the truth about hedonic adaptation and set points is more nuanced: Some people might be more prone than others to adapt to events, and a person’s set point may not be stable over time. Throughout this class, we will explore research—and research-based methods—that suggest how we might counteract our tendency for hedonic adaptation and develop more lasting happiness.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Prioritizing positivity
</span></dt><dd>
Deliberately organizing your day-to-day life so that it contains situations that naturally give rise to positive emotional experiences. Laura Catalino, Sara Algoe and Barbara Fredrickson’s study compares pursuing happiness to prioritizing positivity, and their results suggest that prioritizing positivity is a more promising approach to boosting happiness.

“vagal superstars”—that’s how people like to think about them. And what
we find is a really interesting profile: if you have a really sort of a strong vagal profile,
which you can cultivate through exercise, and recent studies suggest meditation, and
other practices—if you have a strong profile, you have more positive emotion on a daily
basis, stronger relationships with peers, better social support networks, kids in schools,
fifth graders who have a stronger vagal profile are the kids who intervene when a kid is being
bullied. And they cooperate, and will donate time like recess time to help a kid who needs
help on homework. It relates to altruism and prosociality as well, and they’re trusted
more. So another kind of data that says, wow, we think of compassion as this higher order
emotion, but it really is tracking part of our nervous system as well.

active listening
and this is a practice that will help you deepen your connection
and communication enrich the communication you share
with other people since what we’ve been talking about for this week is how
important
interpersonal connections are to your happiness for this practice
you need a carve about 15 to 30 minutes to talk with a close friend
family member a romantic partner someone him you’d think would appreciate an
opportunity perhaps to vent
find a quiet place we can talk without interruption
or distraction and once you’re together invite him or her to share
what on their mind as they’re talking this is where it gets interesting
try to do the following: paraphrase for them
reflect what you think you hear them saying for example
what I hear you saying is or it sounds like or
if I understand you right sort of get really involved in what they’re saying in
understanding it well
ask some questions at the right moments without interrupting
when you say upset do you mean angry or afraid or sad
try to really get to the bottom of what they’re telling you and be empathetic
if they voice negative feelings try to consider what how they feel that way
regardless if what you think but the think their feelings are justified
for example you might say I sense that you’re feeling frustrated or even
I can understand how that situation would have caused you to feel frustrated
engage with your body language lean forward
be open stay relaxed above all
don’t check your cell phone right don’t look for messages or emails
really tune into them avoid making judgments about what they’re saying
really accept their perspective for what it is even if you disagree
try not to interrupt hold back advice sometimes it’s best just to listen and
not try to solve the problem
that they’re sharing with you your presence and understanding
enough itself is very valuable on finally take turns
when there’s a national pause ask if it’s okay for you to share too
and when you do speak try to use what are called I
statements that that mean say how you feel
don’t say what you think about them or what you think they might be feeling
so go ahead try to figure out a time and a person
and practice active listening</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_friends_family_and_happiness"></a>11.29. Friends, Family and Happiness</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

Kindness
</span></dt><dd>
is a general, everyday term describing behaviors that involve being friendly, generous, or considerate. Pro-social is the term favored by scientists to refer to kind, helpful behaviors or states, but it is also quite broad.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Compassion
</span></dt><dd>
Literally means “to suffer together.” Among emotion researchers, it is defined as the feeling that arises when you witness another’s suffering and feel motivated to help relieve that suffering.
Compassion is not the same as empathy or altruism, though the concepts are related. While empathy refers more generally to our ability to sense the emotions—and/or take the perspective—of another person, compassion is when those feelings and thoughts include the desire to help. While altruism is often prompted by compassion, one can feel compassion without acting on it, and altruism isn’t always motivated by compassion.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Altruism
</span></dt><dd>
Altruism is when we act to promote someone else’s welfare, even at a risk or cost to ourselves. Many debate whether and why true (or "pure") altruism actually exists. Evolutionary scientists speculate that altruism has deep roots in human nature because helping and cooperation promote the survival of our species. Indeed, Darwin himself argued that altruism, which he called “sympathy” or “benevolence,” is “an essential part of the social instincts.” Some evolutionary biologists argue that organisms may sometimes put themselves at risk in order to help another because they expect that the other organism will return the favor down the line, a concept known as reciprocal altruism.

Empathy
</span></dt><dd>
As Emiliana explained last week, the term “empathy” is used to describe a wide range of experiences. Emotion researchers generally define empathy as the ability to sense other people’s emotions (affective empathy), coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else might be thinking or feeling (cognitive empathy).

Sympathy
</span></dt><dd>
(partecipazione) Sympathy, which means "to feel together," is sometimes used synonymously with compassion. However, while sympathy does refer to feelings of sorrow or sadness about another person’s suffering, it does not typically involve the urge or motivation to help, or do anything about the situation. In other words, a person may feel sympathetic towards another person’s difficulties, but not feel inclined to help.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Pity
</span></dt><dd>
(Pena) Feeling sorry for the suffering or misfortune of someone else. Pity is similar to compassion, but it suggests a power imbalance, whereby the observer occupies a place of superiority and looks down upon the person who is suffering.

  What’s more, when we give to others, we don’t only make them feel closer to us; we also feel closer to them. “Being kind and generous leads you to perceive others more positively and more charitably,” writes Lyubomirsky in her book The How of Happiness, and this “fosters a heightened sense of interdependence and cooperation in your social community.”

We can start by remaining mindful, carefully and critically evaluating each situation we encounter so that we don’t gloss over an emergency requiring our action. We should try to develop our “discontinuity detector”—an awareness of things that don’t fit, are out of place, or don’t make sense in a setting. This means asking questions to get the information we need to take responsible action.

It is important not to fear interpersonal conflict, and to develop the personal hardiness necessary to stand firm for principles we cherish.

We must remain aware of an extended time-horizon, not just the present moment. We should be engaged in the current situation, yet also be able to detach part of our analytical focus to imagine alternative future scenarios that might play out, depending on different actions or failures to act that we take in the present. In addition, we should keep part of our minds on the past, as that may help us recall values and teachings instilled in us long ago, which may inform our actions in the current situation.
</li><li class="listitem">
We have to resist the urge to rationalize inaction and to develop justifications that recast evil deeds as acceptable means to supposedly righteous ends.

We must try to transcend anticipating negative consequence associated with some forms of heroism, such as being socially ostracized. If our course is just, we must trust that others will eventually recognize the value of our heroic actions.

Forgiveness does not necessarily mean reconciliation with the person that hurt you, or condoning of their action. What you are after is to find peace. Forgiveness can be defined as the “peace and understanding that come from blaming that which has hurt you less, taking the life experience less personally, and changing your grievance story.”
</li><li class="listitem">
Get the right perspective on what is happening. Recognize that your primary distress is coming from the hurt feelings, thoughts and physical upset you are suffering now, not what offended you or hurt you two minutes – or ten years – ago. Forgiveness helps to heal those hurt feelings.

Put your energy into looking for another way to get your positive goals met than through the experience that has hurt you. Instead of mentally replaying your hurt seek out new ways to get what you want.

We suggest that you move through the steps below based on what works for you.</p><div class="orderedlist"><p class="title"><strong>HOW TO DO IT</strong></p><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
Make a list of people who have hurt you deeply enough to warrant the effort to forgive. You can do this by asking yourself on a 1-to-10 scale, How much pain do I have regarding the way this person treated me?with 1 involving the least pain (but still significant enough to justify the time to forgive) and 10 involving the most pain. Then, order the people on this list from least painful to most painful. Start with the person lowest on this hierarchy (least painful).
</li><li class="listitem">
Consider one offense by the first person on your list. Ask yourself: How has this person’s offense negatively impacted by life? Reflect on the psychological and physical harm it may have caused. Consider how your views of humanity and trust of others may have changed as a result of this offense. Recognize that what happened was not okay, and allow yourself to feel any negative emotions that come up.
</li><li class="listitem">
When you’re ready, make a decision to forgive. Deciding to forgive involves coming to terms with what you will be doing as you forgive—extending an act of mercy toward the person who has hurt you. When we offer this mercy, we deliberately try to reduce resentment (persistent ill will) toward this person and, instead, offer him or her kindness, respect, generosity, or even love.
It is important to emphasize that forgiveness does not involve excusing the person’s actions, forgetting what happened, or tossing justice aside. Justice and forgiveness can be practiced together.
Another important caveat: To forgive is not the same as to reconcile. Reconciliation is a negotiation strategy in which two or more people come together again in mutual trust. You may not choose to reconcile with the person you are forgiving.
</li><li class="listitem">
Start with cognitive exercises. Ask yourself these questions about the person who has hurt you: What was life like for this person while growing up? What wounds did he or she suffer from others that could have made him or her more likely to hurt you? What kinds of extra pressures or stresses were in this person’s life at the time he or she offended you? These questions are not meant to excuse or condone, but rather to better understand the other person’s areas of pain, those areas that make him or her vulnerable and human. Understanding why people commit destructive acts can also help us find more effective ways of preventing further destructive acts from occurring in the future.
</li><li class="listitem">
Be aware of any little movement of your heart through which you begin to feel even slight compassion for the person who offended you. This person may have been confused, mistaken, and misguided. He or she may deeply regret his or her actions. As you think about this person, notice if you start to feel softer emotions toward him or her.
</li><li class="listitem">
Try to consciously bear the pain that he or she caused you so that you do not end up throwing that pain back onto the one who offended you, or even toward unsuspecting others, such as loved ones who were not the ones who wounded you in the first place. When we are emotionally wounded, we tend to displace our pain onto others. Please be aware of this so that you are not perpetuating a legacy of anger and injuries.
</li><li class="listitem">
Think of a gift of some kind that you can offer to the person you are trying to forgive. Forgiveness is an act of mercy—you are extending mercy toward someone who may not have been merciful toward you. This could be through a smile, a returned phone call, or a good word about him or her to others. Always consider your own safety first when extending kindness and goodwill towards this person. If interacting with this person could put you in danger, find another way to express your feelings, such as by writing in a journal or engaging in a practice such as compassion meditation.
</li><li class="listitem">
Finally, try to find meaning and purpose in what you have experienced. For example, as people suffer from the injustices of others, they often realize that they themselves become more sensitive to others’ pain. This, in turn, can give them a sense of purpose toward helping those who are hurting. It may also motivate them to work toward preventing future injustices of a similar kind.
</li><li class="listitem">
Once you complete the forgiveness process with one person on your list, select the next person in line and move up that list until you are forgiving the person who hurt you the most.

Few people vote, parents and schools are less active. There’s less philanthropy in low-trust regions, greater crime of all kinds, lower longevity, worse health, lower academic achievement in schools.</p><p>And low-trust areas have greater economic disparities between the very rich and the very poor—and the greater the discrepancy between the very rich and the very poor in a country, the more it predicts economic decline in that country.</p><p>When you add them together, these ratings are a constant, which means that in this interaction, her gain is his loss and his gain is her loss. This is what’s called in game theory a “zero-sum game.”</p><p>Fifty-eight percent of zero-sum game couples’ husbands died over this 20-year period, whereas among “cooperative-gain” couples, who didn’t have that pattern, only 20 percent of husbands died in that 20-year period. This was true even after controlling for the husband’s age and initial health. Now this is an outcome that’s pretty reliably measured: You can really tell if somebody’s dead or alive.</p><p>It turns out that trust is related to the secretion of oxytocin, which is the “cuddle hormone,” the hormone of bonding. It’s also a hormone we secrete when we have an orgasm; the stronger the orgasm, the more oxytocin we secrete.
Interestingly enough, men don’t just secrete oxytocin after an orgasm; they secrete vasopressin as well. Vasopressin is a hormone associated with aggression. After a male rat has had an orgasm with a female rat, he not only is enjoying the experience, he’s also trying to ward off rivals.
So there is evidence that the bonding experience of having an orgasm with somebody—secreting oxytocin, that trust hormone—is very powerful, it suspends fear. But it doesn’t have as protective an effect in men as it does in women.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Sliding doors</p></blockquote></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

Mindfulness
</span></dt><dd>
Though exact definitions vary, Jon Kabat-Zinn and others generally define "mindfulness" as a non-judgmental, moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment. When we practice mindfulness, our thoughts tune into what we’re sensing in the present moment rather than rehashing the past or imagining the future.
</dd></dl></div><p>The "non-judgmental" part of the definition refers to the idea that mindfulness involves acceptance, meaning that we pay attention to our thoughts and feelings without judging them—without believing, for instance, that there’s a “right” or “wrong” way to think or feel in a given moment.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
Meditation
</span></dt><dd>
Though mindfulness and meditation are closely related, they are not synonymous. As Jon Kabat-Zinn describes in his video, one can practice mindfulness while not doing a formal meditation practice, and there are many different kinds of meditation that go beyond mindfulness meditation. The term "meditation" refers to a wide range of practices that simply involve training the mind to achieve a particular state of consciousness, especially for relaxation. That said, mindfulness meditation, based on a technique adapted from Buddhist Vipassana meditation, is a basic and commonly practiced form of meditation.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
</span></dt><dd>
Though it has its roots in Buddhist meditation, a secular practice of mindfulness has entered the mainstream in recent years largely through the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn and his Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, which he launched at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 1979. The MBSR program usually has students meet for two to three hours per week for eight weeks, practicing at home between classes. They learn practices such as the "body scan," in which they focus their attention along each part of the body, trying to be aware and accepting of whatever they sense in these body parts, and the "raisin meditation," where they slowly use all of their senses, one after another, to observe a raisin in great detail, from the way it feels in their hand to the way its taste bursts on the tongue. Over the past 35 years, thousands of studies have documented the physical and mental health benefits of mindfulness in general and MBSR in particular, inspiring countless programs to adapt the MBSR model for schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and beyond. We’ll learn more about these programs later in the week.

Attention
</span></dt><dd>
According to psychologist and philosopher William James, attention "is the taking possession of the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what may seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thoughts…It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others." Many compare attention to a spotlight, which makes certain information from the inside or outside world more available to conscious awareness, while filtering out less useful information. Attention is limited, in that it can only hold a finite quantity of information in mind for a limited period of time, and selective, in that it orients to information that is deemed important in a given moment.

Awareness

Self-awareness points to the ability to attain insight into one’s own attitudes, motives, reactions, strengths and vulnerabilities.

La meditazione basilare è portare l’attenzione sul tuo respiro, inspirare ed espirare. Si può fare in qualunque posizione. I tuo occhi possono essere aperti o chiusi, anche se ad occhi chiusi potrebbe essere possibile mantenere la concentrazione. Può essere utile impostare un tempo per questo esercizio ma anche praticarlo in casi di stress o ansia. L’importante è respirare normalmente e osservare tutte le sensazioni derivanti dal nostro respirare. <a class="ulink" href="../audios/mindfulness/body-scan_ITA.mp3" target="_top">Link file Audio</a>

How to do it
</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
        First, identify something about yourself that makes you feel ashamed, insecure, or not good enough. It could be something related to your personality, behavior, abilities, relationships, or any other part of your life. Once you identify something, write it down and describe how it makes you feel. Sad? Embarrassed? Angry? Try to be as honest as possible, keeping in mind that no one but you will see what you write. The next step is to write a letter to yourself expressing compassion, understanding, and acceptance for the part of yourself that you dislike. As you write, follow these guidelines:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
Imagine that there is someone who loves and accepts you unconditionally for who you are. What would that person say to you about this part of yourself?
</li><li class="listitem">
Remind yourself that everyone has things about themselves that they don’t like, and that no one is without flaws. Think about how many other people in the world are struggling with the same thing that you’re struggling with.
</li><li class="listitem">
Consider the ways in which events that have happened in your life, the family environment you grew up in, or even your genes may have contributed to this negative aspect of yourself.
</li><li class="listitem">
In a compassionate way, ask yourself whether there are things that you could do to improve or better cope with this negative aspect. Focus on how constructive changes could make you feel happier, healthier, or more fulfilled, and avoid judging yourself.
</li><li class="listitem">

Optimism
</span></dt><dd>
Within the field of positive psychology, particularly informed by the work of the late researcher Christopher Peterson of the University of Michigan, optimism is defined as the expectation that the future will be socially desirable, good, and pleasurable.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Maximizers
</span></dt><dd>
A term popularized by psychologist Barry Schwartz of Swarthmore College to refer to people who try to squeeze the greatest amount of benefit and pleasure out of every choice or opportunity.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Satisficers
</span></dt><dd>
by contrast, feel content with choices as long as they pass a basic threshold of acceptability. Schwartz and colleagues have found that maximizers report low happiness and optimism and higher levels of depression than people who have a greater tendency to satisfice.

Self-compassion
</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
Kristin Neff, who pioneered the scientific study of self-compassion, generally defines it as quieting one’s inner critic and replacing it with a voice of support, understanding, and care for one’s self—in other words, treating yourself with the same kind of compassion that you show to other people. By Neff’s account, there are three core components of self-compassion:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
self-kindness, meaning that we are gentle and understanding with ourselves rather than harshly critical and judgmental;
</li><li class="listitem">
recognizing our common humanity, meaning that we feel connected to others in the experience of life rather than feeling isolated and alienated by our suffering;
</li><li class="listitem">
mindfulness, meaning that we are aware of our pain or suffering but keep that observation in perspective, rather than ignoring our pain or exaggerating it.

Flow
</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
A concept developed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi that refers to "the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it," four factors that are essential to flow: :
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
performing a task or activity where the degree of challenge is properly balanced with one’s ability to complete it;
</li><li class="listitem">
one’s goal is clear;
</li><li class="listitem">
there’s constant and immediate feedback about how close one is to achieving that goal;
</li><li class="listitem">
one is able to devote complete concentration to the task at hand.
</li></ol></div></dd><dt><span class="term">
Intrinsic goals
</span></dt><dd>
According to positive psychologist Tim Kasser and colleagues, intrinsic goals "are those that are inherently satisfying to pursue because they are likely to satisfy innate psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, competence, and growth"; they depend on satisfying one’s own basic psychological needs rather than relying upon the judgments or approval of others. Examples of these goals include self-acceptance, forming social connections, and physical fitness.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Extrinsic goals
</span></dt><dd>
on the other hand, are focused on attaining rewards and/or praise from others—they are a means to an end, not inherently rewarding in and of themselves. Examples include financial wealth, fame, or popularity. People often pursue extrinsic goals under the assumption that these goals will bring them happiness, but evidence suggests otherwise. Researchers speculate that intrinsic goals lead to greater happiness because, in the pursuit of these goals, people have positive experiences along the way that support their happiness.
</dd></dl></div><p><strong>Esercizio: BEST POSSIBLE SELF. </strong>For the next 15 minutes, write continuously in the space below about what you imagine this best possible future to be. Use the instructions below to help guide you through this process.
. It may be easy for this exercise to lead you to examine how your current life may not match this best possible future. You may be tempted to think about ways in which accomplishing goals has been difficult for you in the past, or about financial/time/social barriers to being able to make these accomplishments happen. For the purpose of this exercise, however, we encourage you to focus on the future—imagine a brighter future in which you are your best self and your circumstances change just enough to make this best possible life happen.
. This exercise is most useful when it is very specific—if you think about a new job, imagine exactly what you would do, who you would work with, and where it would be. The more specific you are, the more engaged you’ll be in the exercise and the more you’ll get out of it.
. Be as creative and imaginative as you want, and don’t worry about grammar or spelling.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" class="blockquote" style="width: 100%; cellspacing: 0; cellpadding: 0;" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Tra cinque anni arriverò all’età di 45.

TRa cinque anni l’azienda si sarà accorta di questo effetto e, con crescente sorpresa mi avrà ampliato responsabilità lasciandomi lavorare al benessere dei dipendenti per poterli far rendere al meglio. Nel frattempo imparerò come poter cindividere le scoperte sul flow e la felicità perchè tutti vedranno che con inapparente sforzo tutti gli eventi portano ad un benessere maggiore per me e per chi mi sta vicino. Tutti saranno trasformati e lavorerò nell’azienda più felice d’Italia, verrò incaricato di condividere la mia esperienza anche con le filiali estere e comincerò a valutare di operare una start up, spinto dall’agente che mi aiuta nella pubblicazione dei saggi e dei libri di narrativa che sembrano uscire come per magia dalla mia mente. Tutta la mia famiglia sarà felice, ed avremo tempo per viaggiare attorno al mondo per un tour che organizzerò per promuovere la filosofia "Make it happien" attorno a tutto il globo.
